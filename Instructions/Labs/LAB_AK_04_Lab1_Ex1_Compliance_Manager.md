## Task 2 - Explore Compliance Manager

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** and navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**. Log into the Microsoft Purview compliance portal center as **Joni Sherman**.

1. Select **Compliance Manager** from the left navigation pane.

1. From the top of the Compliance Manager page, ensure **Overview** is selected (underlined). Scroll down to see all the information available on the page. Information on this page includes your compliance score, your points achieved, and Microsoft managed points achieved. You'll see Key improvement actions, Solutions that affect your score and compliance score breakdown by categories.

1. From the top of the Overview page, select **Improvement actions**. These are actions that can improve the organizationâ€™s compliance score. Note that as improvement actions are taken, points may take up to 24 hours to update. Notice the available filters.

1. From the list of improvement actions, select **Enable self-service password reset**. Review the available information for the improvement action. The left side of the window provides a brief overview about the implementation, test status, and more. To the right of the overview is the details page from which you can select implementation, testing, the related standards and regulatory requirements, and documents. Each of these tabs provides more detailed information for the improvement action.

1. Exit out of this improvement action by selecting **Improvement Actions** from the breadcrumb on the top left of the page. You're now back on the improvement actions page.

1. From the top of the page, select **Assessments**. On this page, you'll see the **Data Protection Baseline for Microsoft 365**.

This baseline assessment has a set of controls for key regulations and standards for data protection and general data governance. Compliance Manager becomes more helpful as you add your own assessments to meet your organization's particular needs.

1. Select the **Data Protection Baseline** assessment. On the left side of the page is the overview that includes details and about information. Expand the **About** section and review the description about the Microsoft 35 data protection baseline.

1. Select **Assessments** from the top navigation breadcrumb.

1. Select **+ Add assessments** to launch the assessment creation wizard.

<!--Sure, here's another example scenario:


Your organization is a financial services provider that handles sensitive financial data. You want to ensure that you are compliant with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) regulations.


To create an assessment for GLBA, you can use the Compliance Manager templates provided by Microsoft. You can then customize the assessment to fit the specific needs of your organization.


For example, you can create an assessment for the Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect customer information. You can then create improvement actions for each control in the assessment and test them to ensure compliance.


Remember to regularly review and update your assessment to ensure ongoing compliance with GLBA regulations.>
