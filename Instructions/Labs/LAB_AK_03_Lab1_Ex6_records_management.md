# Lab 3 - Exercise 6 - Configure Records Management

In this exercise, you will assume the role of Joni Sherman, a Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. Regulatory requirements for your organization include having a definitive copy of the employee provided health insurance information available when your company discusses the insurance costs. You are tasked with making sure the records are kept.

## Task 1 – Create File Plan Labels

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal, in the left navigation pane, select **Records management**.

1. On the **Records management** page, select **File plan**.

1. Select **+ Create a label**.

1. Enter the following information, then select **next**:

    - **Name**: Employee Data
    - **Description for users**: Content marked with this label contains sensitive employee data.

1. On the **Choose what happens during the retention period** page, select **Mark items as a record**, then select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose what happens after the retention period** page, select **Delete items automatically**, then select **Next**.

1. On the **Review and finish** page, select the **Create label** button.  On the *Your retention label is created* page select **Do Nothing** option and select **Done**.

You successfully created a retention label using file plan that keeps all labeled documents from being deleted for seven years and at the end of the retention period the records get deleted automatically.

## Task 2 – Publish Labels

In this task, you will publish the label so users of the HR department can apply it to content containing health insurance information.
